# Higher Education for Underrepresented Groups - Supported by the Government of Massachusetts?

## Heuristic Evaluation - Chinmaya Vempati, DH110-F21

### Overview

Higher education has undergone a shift in its cultural & societal role in the last decade. As the younger generations of today contend with issues such as ever-increasing costs of living and a heavy & borderline predatory student debt system, there has been an increasing drive to stop treating higher education—a well-reported pathway for upward mobility in the socioeconomic ladder—as a privilege only available to the few, and rather think of higher education as a right accessible to all those who want it, especially underrepresented and marginalised groups who have historically faced exclusion from these spaces of learning. Meaningfully effecting this change necessitates, in large part, being codified in social support systems that the government is responsible for. 

In this vein, the government of Massachusetts has established a number of online resources to help guide prospective users through the landscape of resources and systems that may help make higher education more accessible for them. This is precisely the space I intend to delve into to explore how effectively these have actually been implemented, and not only evaluate how good they are at meeting the needs of the underrepresented, but also ideate and explore how much better they could be. How meaningful are the resources & solutions they spotlight to the users they’re intended for? Does the user experience of the resources clearly guide them through this unfamiliar domain, or unintentionally obfuscate it further? And most importantly, how do we evaluate where we are so we can push the envelope towards where we could be? 

### [Nielsen's Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

| No. | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | Users should always be informed about what is going on and should be given appropriate feedback to their actions |
| 2 | Match Between System and the Real World | Use concepts and language that are familiar and logical to the user |
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | Allow users to make mistakes; give them options to undo and redo tasks |
| 4 | Consistency and Standards | Follow conventions and make sure design is consistent across the platform |
| 5 | Error Prevention | Get rid of error-prone conditions and provide users with safety nets for high-cost errors |
| 6 | Recognition Rather Than Recall | Minimize user's memory load by giving them suggestions and help in context |
| 7 | Flexibility and Efficiency of Use | Provide multiple ways to perform a task to make the platform accessible to all users |
| 8 | Aesthetic and Minimalist Design | Provide only relevant content and features |
| 9 | Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover From Errors | Tell users what the problem is and provide suggestions to fix it |
| 10 | Help and Documentation | Supply users with extra help to complete their tasks |


### [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)

The following rating scale can be used to evaluate the severity of usability issues:
| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority |

Ratings are displayed in parentheses after each usability issue.
